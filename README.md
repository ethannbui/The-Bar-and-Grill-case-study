# The Bar & Grill Scalability Case Study (2025)

As a participant of the Restaurant365 competition, I analyzed a fictional fast-growing restaurant group (The Bar & Grill) and developed practical recommendations to scale operations and financial processes, covering finance, operations, technology, and legal considerations.

**Business Context**

The Bar & Grill started as a single casual dining location in Henderson (Las Vegas) and grew rapidly after being mentioned by a popular YouTuber—driving about 40% annual sales growth and expansion to five locations. As it scaled, the company accumulated complexity: multiple legal entities and separate accounting instances per store.

**Result:**
From the case and our team analysis, key issues include:
- Delayed reporting: store managers receive monthly P/L about 2 weeks after month-end, making it “utterly useless” for operations. 
- 3rd-party delivery drag: delivery partners can take ~40% per ticket, plus chargebacks and manual reconciliation workload.
- DoorDash reconciliation burden: about 40% of sales through DoorDash; reconciling expected vs received can take ~10 hours/month per store and scales admin headcount. 
- Cash management mess: each restaurant gets about $1,000/day cash, with manual deposits and ad-hoc purchases from tills that are often mis-accounted. 



**Recommendations:** 

**Labor (Scheduling + staffing)**
- Reduce idle hours and shift staffing to peak sales periods.
- Cross-train employees to increase flexibility without adding headcount. 

**Delivery (Protect margin + reduce overhead)**
- Optimize delivery menu for profitability and reduce refunds/chargebacks.
- Reduce reconciliation time and negotiate better commission terms.
- Long-term: diversify platforms and build more direct ordering channels. 

**Finance ops (Make reporting useful)**
- Move toward faster close cycles (weekly ops reporting), and standardize processes so store-level P/L is timely and trusted.
